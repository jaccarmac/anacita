moving for wrong reasons

Need to transcribe the episode of Kreative Kontrol with Joe Casey about
/Relatives/ ([[http://vishkhanna.com/2017/10/17/ep-357-protomartyrs-joe-casey/][#357]]). It's INSANE. Can easily make the game about the whole dang
record. Rights will be tricky. Author "Primarily Protomartyr, with some by
Jacob MacDonald". Open with something percussive.

There's a bit about a marble emperor, a tie-in point for the Marble King myth
from Greece.
